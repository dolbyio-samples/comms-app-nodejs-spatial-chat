# Enable Spatial Audio in your web applications

##Overview
At Dolby.io, we aim to deliver the best experience for your real-time communication needs. We have introduced the Spatial Audio capability in the Dolby.io Communications APIs as the most recent step to make your end userâ€™s experience better. This allows you to place conference participants in a 3D rendered audio scene and hear the participants from the given locations.

This GitHub repo contains the source code of the sample application presented in [this guide to enabling spatial audio in you web applications](https://dolby.io/blog/enabling-spatial-audio-in-your-web-applications/).

## Requirements
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.
- A [Dolby.io Account](https://dashboard.dolby.io/signup).
- A code editor.
- A Microphone connected up to your test device.

## Content of the repository

Two folders are available, `original` for the base sample application that is used in the blog post and `final` that contains the source code of the sample application after adding the code for Spatial Audio.

The sample application contains the following files:
- *index.html* - web page that you need to use to display the application.
- *styles.css* - some simple styles for the application.
- *actions.js* - JavaScript used for the actions likes turning on and off the camera or muting and unmuting the microphone.
- *videos.js* - JavaScript that contains the event handlers for the video streams.
- *utils.js* - JavaScript that contains some utility functions
- *server.js* - Node.JS application that will start a small web server to deliver the web application locally.

## Getting Started

You first must install the package dependencies by running the command:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a file called `.env` in your application folder and set the application key and secret that you got from your dolby.io dashboard.

```
APP_KEY=<YOUR_APP_KEY_HERE>
APP_SECRET=<YOUR_APP_SECRET_HERE>
```

Run the web server using the `npm` command:

```bash
npm run start
```

Then you can access the application at http://localhost:8081
